# A-Moebe

A-Moebe is a gamerunner which is used for an escaperoom made with Python and JavaScript and a whole bunch of Raspberry Pi's.

@kevvie303 is the mastermind behind this gamerunner, having written all the code from scratch. A few examples of the things he made possible are:
* Creating a localhost on the Pi which you can also use on other locations;
* Writing code that allows you to lock and unlock magnets, and also control keypads to unlock a magnet;
* Creating a system with which you can add, control, play, pause, resume and delete media files. Playing is controlled over multiple soundcards and multiple pi's;
* Making sure it's possible to use buttons on the localhost in your browser that can control the magnets;
* Making the basic styling.
  
@romyjkk makes sure the HTML is semantic and the CSS is done the 'right' way.

Both of us are students who are doing this as a side project to learn more about the topics we're interested in and use our skills to help our friend who's dream it is to make his own escaperoom.
